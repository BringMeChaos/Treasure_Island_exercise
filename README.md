# Treasure_Island_exercise
This is an exercise from the Udemy course 100 days of code: Python. this exercise focuses on basic if statements, it's an text base, ascii art game.  The idea itself was interesting, I want to add more things as I learn more, and maybe have it as a mini game in the future :)
